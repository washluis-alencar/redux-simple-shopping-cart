# React Shopping Cart with Redux Toolkit

This is a sample React application that demonstrates the implementation of a basic shopping cart using Redux and Redux Toolkit. The project showcases how to manage application state using Redux Toolkit, a powerful and opinionated library for efficient Redux development.

## Features

- Add products to the cart
- Remove products from the cart
- Update the quantity of products in the cart
- Calculate the total price of items in the cart (next releases)
- Store the cart state using Redux

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- Redux Toolkit: An opinionated, efficient Redux development toolset
- HTML and CSS: For structuring and styling the application
- JavaScript: The programming language used for application logic

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a standard React project layout with the following important files and directories:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable UI components.
- `src/services`: Contains the API call to external backend app.
- `src/store`: Contains the Redux slice for managing the cart state, including actions, reducers, and thunks.
